1. I choose to analyze the topic of vaccination because it addresses a critical aspect of public health. Vaccination is a potent tool in preventing severe illness and death cause by the virus. The vaccines have demonstrated efficacy in reducing the severity of symptoms and the risk of fatal outcomes, making them pivotal in protecting individuals and also the communities. 
2. The uniqueness lies in the efficacy of vacines, not just individual protection but also in contributing to community well-being.
3. This project is considered a data science project because it it help identify areas that we should be aware of, offering a evidence-based of vaccination impact.
